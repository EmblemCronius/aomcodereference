AoM Code Reference
==================

What's this?
------------
This project uses a combination of the Java programming language and the JavaDoc tool to produce a reference for internal commands used by the game Age of Mythology, its expansion pack and the extended edition.

Where can I find the reference?
-------------------------------
Right here: https://mythicfreak.github.io/aomcodereference/

I found some errors/inconsistencies in your reference!
------------------------------------------------------
That's very possible. I pulled this reference together from many different sources in addition to my own experience as an XS scripter, so small errors are no doubt present. On top of that, this project has been a work in progress for a couple of years now, and it will hopefully continue to be updated for the foreseeable future. 

In any case, pull requests with bugfixes or new even information are always welcome!
